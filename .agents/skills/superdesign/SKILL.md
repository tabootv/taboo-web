  Superdesign is a design agent specialized in frontend UI/UX design. Use this skill before implementing any UI that requires design thinking. Common commands: superdesign create-project --title "X" (setup project), superdesign create-design-draft --project-id <id> --title "Current UI" -p "Faithfully reproduce..." --context-file src/Component.tsx (faithful reproduction), superdesign iterate-design-draft --draft-id <id> -p "dark theme" -p "minimal" --mode branch --context-file src/Component.tsx (design variations), superdesign execute-flow-pages --draft-id <id> --pages '[...]' --context-file src/Component.tsx (extend to more pages). Supports line ranges: --context-file path:startLine:endLine

SuperDesign helps you (1) find design inspirations/styles and (2) generate/iterate design drafts on an infinite canvas.

# Core scenarios (what this skill handles)

1. **superdesign init** — Analyze the repo and build UI context to `.superdesign/init/`
2. **Help me design X** (feature/page/flow)
3. **Set design system**
4. **Help me improve design of X**

# Init: Repo Analysis

When `.superdesign/init/` directory doesn't exist or is empty, you MUST automatically:
1. Create the `.superdesign/init/` directory
2. Fetch the init prompt from the URL below
3. Follow the prompt instructions to analyze the repo and write context files

```

Do NOT ask the user to do this manually — just do it.

# MANDATORY: Read Init Files Every Time

**CRITICAL**: When `.superdesign/init/` exists, you MUST read ALL files in this directory at the START of every design task:
- `components.md` — shared UI primitives inventory
- `layouts.md` — full source code of layout components
- `routes.md` — route/page mapping
- `theme.md` — design tokens, CSS variables, Tailwind config

These files contain pre-analyzed codebase context that is ESSENTIAL for accurate design reproduction. Reading them is NOT optional — it's mandatory for every design task.


# Superdesign CLI (MUST run before any command)

**IMPORTANT: Before running ANY superdesign command, you MUST ensure the CLI is installed and logged in.**

Follow these steps in order — do NOT skip any step:

1. Check if CLI is already installed:
   ```
   superdesign --version
   ```
   - If the command succeeds (prints a version), **skip installation** and go to step 2.
   - If the command fails (not found), install the CLI:
     ```
     npm install -g @superdesign/cli@latest
     ```
2. Check login status by running any command (e.g. `superdesign --help`). If you see an auth/login error, run:
   ```
   superdesign login
   ```
   Wait for login to complete successfully before proceeding.
3. Only after login succeeds, run your intended superdesign commands.

> **Never assume the user is already logged in.** Always verify login first.
